Summary
The electricity markets are facing rising concerns when it comes to price volatility and the growing shift towards renewable energy, which makes understanding the electricity price dynamics exceptionally important for market stability. In this thesis it is studied how do renewable electricity generation, alongside consumption, trade flows, and weather conditions influence the day-ahead electricity market prices across Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, with using country-level hourly data between 2020 and 2024.
The theoretical framework is based on the merit-order effect, which lowers market-clearing prices by introducing the low marginal cost renewables, moreover it also introduces the concepts of market interconnectivity, market coupling, and cross-border spill-over effects, which puts light on the structural bases of electricity trading in the Europe and the Nord Pool area. Furthermore, there is also an emphasis on the relevance and the effect of European gas prices on electricity prices.
The thesis uses fixed effects panel data estimation with instrumental variables method by two- stage least squares (2SLS) estimation to account for endogeneity in the renewable electricity generation, and it also applies Driscroll-Kraay standard errors to correct for heterogeneity and serial correlation. The analysis is focusing on one main model, which tests the main explanatory variables’ effects on the day-ahead prices across the Nordic region: consumption, renewable electricity generation, net imports, temperature, rainfall, with adding daily and monthly time controls, while wind speed and sunshine duration were used as instruments for the renewable electricity generation. Moreover, on top of the main model five significant robustness tests were done (out of which two are in the appendix), which deepened the understanding of the market by separating the effects by countries, and by adding Dutch TTF day-ahead gas prices, and by also separating the TTF model by countries (while the last two are focusing on the exceptionally high renewable period’s effect on prices in the whole region and also separately by countries).
The key limitations of the thesis are lying in the use of only capital cities for weather-related data and the use of country-level renewable electricity generation, instead of source-and- country-specific generation. Moreover, while in most models the used IV methods are addressing the endogeneity problem in the renewable generation, the two robustness models in the appendix are still raising concerns when it comes to their high RES dummy coefficients.
The empirical findings showed throughout all model specifications that consumption is a increasing the prices, while renewable electricity generation, temperature, rain and weekend days are driving down the day-ahead electricity prices, moreover the models that included the TTF day-ahead gas prices also showed that the gas prices are positively impacting the electricity spot prices, however the different countries showed different sensitivities to both renewable output and gas prices.
Overall, the analysis confirmed the renewable electricity’s role in shaping the electricity prices throughout the Nordic market, while the findings have practical implications for market participants, regulatory organizations and for policymakers as well, since they are important when it comes to managing volatility and price formation in a market where renewable penetration is already high and is still growing. Based on the findings, the electricity markets have to account for not only increased renewable capacity, but they also have to take intoconsideration the complexity that comes from cross-country trade, weather changes and alternative fuel prices and their availability.
